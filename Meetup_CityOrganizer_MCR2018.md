# Meetup City Organizer Application - Manchester

In December 2017, I was selected to apply to be a City Organizer for Meetup in [Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/Organiser-Meetup-Manchester/). You can view my application below - I was offered the role of Assistant Organizer, which I ultimately (and reluctantly) had to decline due to time constraints.

***



We’re so excited to launch the Organizer Network and learn from local leaders like you. If you’re selected, you’ll be creating a local community of organizers while sharpening your skills as a mentor, organizer, and leader.

City Organizers will coach, empower, and inspire local organizers to:
- Build a network of passionate members that feel like family
- Grow a team of reliable leaders that you can count on
- Schedule events where attendees show up and contribute    
- Use our tools to build your relationships    
- Network and connect with other local organizers, just like you
- Try new techniques to improve the quality of your groups    

The expected time spent to be a City Organizer is:
- 5 hours for our initial Meetup community leader coaching
- 3 hours once a month for hosting new organizers, in addition to the time you normally need to run your current Meetup group(s)
- Meetup may offer additional leadership workshops and/or product training throughout your tenure
    
We hope you’re as excited about the Organizer Network as we are. We can’t wait to learn more about you.

### 5. Tell us in 140 characters what wisdom you are excited to share about your city.
Manchester is a vibrant city with culture rich in arts, sports & STEM - reflected in the abundance of Meetups which bring everyone together. 

### 6. Do you have access to phone, email, and video communication? 
Yes

Morning (8am to noon), Afternoon (noon to 4pm)

### 8. As a City Organizer, you’ll embody the values of Meetup in your city and help other organizers grow their communities. What about this opportunity excites you?  (150 words)
I am passionate about openness, equity, diversity and inclusion. I advocate for these values in my current role as Open Science Champion at the University of Manchester. Open Science is the movement to encourage collaboration over competition by making scientific research more transparent and research outputs freely available and accessible to all. I view Open Science as the gateway to a more inclusive, diverse and supportive culture in research and gaining back public trust in science. The role of City Organizer is the perfect opportunity to advance these values on a much larger scale - by helping other organizers grow their communities in a welcoming and inclusive way to bring more Mancunians together. I am also eager to learn and grow as a community leader/role model and meet other Meetup Organizers with the same values.

### 9. Do you have previous experience with mentorship or training (within or outside of Meetup)? 
Yes, I have experience through work

### 10. Please explain: (280 characters)
From 2015-2017 I supervised Transition Year students (ages 15-17) on one-week projects in astrophysics which involved training them on the methods to obtain and interpret the results, and mentoring them on how to pursue a career in astrophysics. 

### 11. What role does community play in your life?  (75 words)
Community plays the important role of inspiration in my life. My motivation to advocate for gender balance in tech, accessibility for underrepresented groups and desire to tackle challenges with data is continuously re-energised by attending meetups. Through community building, I have grown in confidence to initiate conversations, start projects, and apply for jobs. Through organising Her+Data MCR, I am more inspired than ever to empower women and showcase role models to combat imposter syndrome.

### 12. If a new organizer said they were unhappy with their Meetup group’s progress after the first month, how would you keep them motivated? (100 words)
At such an early stage, I think it’s important to remind them that community building is an investment which requires time and effort. I would ask to hear about their methods of organisation and offer organisational advice where I can. For example, is the group clashing with similar Meetups? Try testing a new meeting time or reaching out to that group about coordinating a joint event! I would also recommend recruiting a co-organiser - to have a go-to partner with similar interests to bounce ideas off of and for support which would help generate motivation and inspiration throughout the year. 

### 13. As a City Organizer, you will be advising organizers on all types of groups. What are the top 3 common challenges that new organizers of any group encounter and how would you address them? (150 words)
In my opinion, the most important challenge to overcome is ensuring that the group is as welcoming, diverse and inclusive as possible, which will vary in difficulty depending on the focus of the group or activity. Some ways a new organiser can address this are by having a code of conduct in place to help safeguard against offensive language and behaviour, offering leadership roles to members from underrepresented communities, choosing speakers thoughtfully, providing detailed information to your members prior to the meetup, allowing members to contribute to the event, and choosing locations that are as accessible to all abilities as possible. The other top challenges for new organisers are attracting new members to the group and maintaining momentum. These two challenges can be addressed by engaging with members of the group, continuously requesting and implementing feedback, experimenting with different promotion tools and social media, and avoiding burnout through self care.

### 14. We know you have other responsibilities in your personal and professional life. Are you devoted to committing time to being a City Organizer, too? 
Yes! I have other commitments, but I’m willing to do my best to make this work.

### 15. Pick one of these qualities: Welcoming, Impactful, Real, Thoughtful, Spirited. How do you and your group(s) exemplify that quality?  (100 words)
Impactful. Her+Data MCR exemplifies impact by providing a platform and safe space for women to showcase their achievements and build their confidence in a supportive environment. The group has already demonstrated this impact through empowering women with the confidence to apply for roles they would not have otherwise, as women are less likely to apply for jobs unless they are 100% qualified, whereas men have the confidence to apply when they are less qualified (https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified). Her+Data MCR also promotes active engagement by removing the barriers that result in women asking fewer questions than men at seminars (https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21732082-there-easy-fix-women-ask-fewer-questions-men-seminars).
