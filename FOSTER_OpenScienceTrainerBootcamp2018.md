# FOSTER Open Science Trainer Bootcamp 2018 Application

Below is my successful application to attend the FOSTER Open Science Trainer Bootcamp, which I submitted on October 30th, 2017 and the bootcamp took place April 18-20, 2018.


### Scientific discipline 
Astronomy & Astrophysics

### Position 
PostDoc

### Institution 
University of Manchester

### Country 
United Kingdom

### Tell us a little about your experience or skills in open science? (This will help us target the workshop content) (up to 200 words) 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) within the University of Manchester (UoM). I practice open access by making preprints of my publications available on the astrophysics arXiv, I practice open data by publishing my small datasets on GitHub and larger datasets on an institute server, and I practice open source by making my code and scripts for data analysis available on GitHub. In addition to my research, I am currently working to install an open science agenda within the JBCA, by advocating, promoting and organising events related to open science in astronomy. I attended Open Science Fair 2017 and have been sponsored by UoM to attend OpenCon in November 2017.

I am part of the current cohort of Mozilla Open Leaders, where I receive mentorship and open leadership training through the Mozilla Network on a project to advance open research: Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA). My project ROSA aims to collaboratively compile and tailor open science best practices from around the web into a kit for astronomers to work openly from proposal to publication.

### Tell us a little about your experience in training or running workshops? (This will help us target the workshop content) (up to 200 words) 

I conducted a session at the UoM Library's Open Research Forum as part of Open Access Week 2017 where I talked about how working open has made an impact on my career and I conducted a friendly interactive introduction to GitHub. I demonstrated how to start a project, use the interface, walked through GitHub jargon and illustrated how GitHub can be an online portfolio for open and collaborative research.

I organised a session at Mozilla Festival 2017 which facilitated a discussion on the barriers and benefits of open research practices. Participants provided insight into their experiences and then worked together to compile a set of tools to enable researchers to practice open access/data/source/science!

I am currently collaborating with Research Data Services at the UoM Library to pilot Research Data Management (RDM) training as part of the JBCA Autumn Computing Sessions (JACS) in December 2017 to train postgraduate students on best open data practices.

### Successful applicants are required to deliver open science training event(s) following completion of the bootcamp. Please specify your plans for this over the next 20 months (up to May 2019). (up to 500 words) 

*Please include as much detail as possible. You could reflect on the form of training sessions/courses (lectures, expert talks, talks by peers, panel sessions, workshops, hands-on-training sessions, e-learning courses, etc.). Please also tell us how regular do you plan to provide this kind of training and whether these will be stand-alone sessions or a part of a larger course/training programme, etc.*

I am currently working to install an open science agenda within the JBCA, which is the perfect springboard to advance Openness in astronomy as it reaches more people than most other astronomy institutes - it hosts conferences, workshops, training courses, summer schools, seminars/colloquia and conducts public outreach through the Jodcast (podcast), the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre and the Bluedot festival. I am working to infuse open science into these pre-established forums such as the through the RDM training as part of JACS described above.

Based on the outcome and feedback of the JACS RDM training session in December 2017, I will refine this training and design an additional open science training session for the Autumn 2018 term: Intro to Open Access and Collaborative Writing, which will cover funding requirements, Green vs Gold open access, publishing preprints on arXiv, and how to use platforms such as Overleaf and Authorea for collaborative writing and version control.

I am also responsible for assessing the open science training of doctoral students in Data Intensive Science at UoM. In their first year, students will be required to complete the Open Data online training course created by project partner Mozilla Science Lab (https://mozillascience.github.io/open-data-primers/). This training is progressive and students will also be encouraged to complete the Open Leadership Training course created by Mozilla in the later years of their PhD. I will be designing the assessment for these courses, and the first Open Data trainings will take place during the 2017-2018 school year. I will refine this training and assessment for 2018-2019 based on the outcomes and feedback from the current year.

In late spring of 2018 (exact date still to be determined), I will be organising a one day open science workshop at UoM. The workshop will have invited speakers and hands-on interactive sessions. The preliminary session topics include: 
An introductory session on What IS Open Science - importance of open access/data/source/. Invite Kristie Whitaker (Turing Institute) to present on Reproducible Research.
A session on perceived barriers to open science and how there actually aren't any barriers by presenting the benefits associated with open practices, impact, requirement by EU, etc. Invite Jon Tennant to present on this topic. This session could also include the topic of diversity and inclusivity in science.
A session lead by the UoM Library presenting the services and facilities that the library provides and how they can actively support researchers at every stage of the research process. This can be incorporated into a session on RDM lead by the Research Data Services team at the Library, which will cover topics such as metadata, FAIR metrics, licensing, etc.
An interactive Git/GitHub tutorial with an interface tour of GitHub, jargon busting, and discussion of how GitHub can be used for collaboration, for project management, and as an online portfolio for research projects. Participants will then set up accounts, start a project and fork a repository to set up their GitHub (web)page.


### Why would you like to participate in this open science trainer bootcamp? (up to 200 words) 

FOSTER has the network, expertise and resources to empower me to be the best Open Science Champion I can be. Participating will introduce me to the tools and training to hone my own skills, develop, refine and install an open science agenda at the JBCA, and enable me to effectively teach these skills to others. Most of what I have learned about open research has been self-taught and therefore more structured training through this bootcamp would allow me to grow as an open leader and strengthen my teaching and dissemination skills on topics ranging from data collection/management, to publication and public engagement. I have learned a lot about running an open science project through the Mozilla Open Leaders program, however I feel that I can grow and improve in order to effectively teach these skills to others. I want to cultivate change in the culture of the astronomy (and wider research) community to be more collaborative, iterative and open which is vital in order to pursue answers to fundamental questions about our Universe and inspire the next generation of researchers in STEM.
