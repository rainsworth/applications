# My OpenCon 2017 Application

I include below my responses to the Interest in OpenCon section of the application I submitted to attend OpenCon 2018 (the other sections of the application related to personal information which I do not include here).



## **Interest in OpenCon**

_The following questions are designed to help us get to know you and why you are interested in OpenCon. This is the most important part of your application. Please answer questions in English and pay careful attention to the limits on length._


### **What is your primary OpenCon area of interest?**

_Select the OpenCon issue area that interests you most. We understand that many applicants are interested in multiple issues on this list, but it is helpful to know which one you consider most interesting. Please note that OpenCon focuses on these issues in the specific context of research and education._

 Open Science


### **Who are you?**

_Please tell us briefly about yourself. This may include what you do for work, what you study, what projects youâ€™re involved in, or what you are passionate about. Maximum 280 characters (~35 words)._

Research Associate and Open Science Champion at the University of Manchester. Also a FOSTER Open Science Trainer, Mozilla Open Leader alum and Organiser of the women in data meetup group HER+Data MCR. Passionate about promoting openness, inclusivity and well-being in STEM.


### **Why are you interested in OpenCon?**

_In your own words, tell us why you are interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how these issues relate to your work. If you are already working on these issues please tell us how. Maximum 1000 characters (~175 words)._

Much like other scientific fields, the astronomy community can be a closed and stressful environment. Although Astronomy has been very successful in open access on arXiv and is making great strides in the areas of open data and source, we still have a long way to go in making the community welcoming, diverse and making open science practices widespread - many view open science practices as too much effort without much reward.

I view Open Science as the gateway to a more inclusive and supportive culture in research and gaining back public trust in science. I want to shift the mindset of researchers, and more specifically, frame the mindset of incoming early career researchers, to view open science practices in a more positive way by demonstrating how openness can benefit them and accelerate their careers by increasing the integrity of their results, the efficiency of their workflows, citation rates, impact, sustainability, funding and job opportunities.


### **What are your ideas for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data?**

_The biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action to advance Open Access, Open Education and Open Data. Tell us what ideas you have for taking action on these issues, and how you would use (or are currently using) your experience with OpenCon to have an impact. Maximum 1000 characters (~175 words)._

Attending OpenCon 2017 transformed me into a more confident advocate, allowing me to empower other researchers with the skills to work openly. I have since completed Open Leadership Training through the Mozilla Open Leaders program (Round 4) where I developed an Open Science how-to kit for Astronomers. I was then invited to act as mentor and cohort host, where I helped cultivate the next round of open practitioners. I was also trained and certified as an Open Science Trainer by FOSTER, which expanded my network and expertise on speaking about all things open. I have additionally spoken at astronomy conferences about the benefits of Open Science in research, have delivered workshops within my department and have been interviewed on these topics for various podcasts (such as the Method, the Jodcast and the Open Science Radio). Attending OpenCon 2018 as an alum will allow me to give back to the community that has given me so much and rejuvenate me for continued advocacy in 2019.


### Event Participation^

_All of the events listed below are global and open to participation, so anyone, anywhere can be involved. Please indicate which of the following events you have participated in, or plan to participate in next year. Check all that apply._

Open Access Week, Open Data Day


### For the events you checked, briefly explain what you did or plan to do.

_Maximum 600 characters (~100 words)._

As part of Open Access Week 2017, the University of Manchester Library hosted an Open Research Forum where I was invited to give an introduction to GitHub. I demonstrated how to use the platform as an online portfolio for open and collaborative research.

For (NYC's) Open Data Week (March 3-10, 2017), I organized an Open Data-themed event on International Women's Day for the women in data meetup group I run, HER+Data MCR. We had lightning talks from Tania Allard on community engagement in data, Rosie Higman on sharing data in research and Linda Humphries on sharing data in industry.
