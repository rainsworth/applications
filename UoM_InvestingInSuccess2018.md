The Open Movement is gaining momentum across the globe. “Open” refers to working collaboratively, making research outputs freely accessible for others to use in order to maximise impact, and promoting inclusion, equity and diversity in research. Initiatives such as Mozilla Open Leaders, OpenCon and Open Access Week are shining a spotlight on the academic, economic and societal benefits of Openness, and inspiring the next generation of researchers to initiate change. The proposed project for which the funding will be used is comprised of four activities relating to Open Science which aim to both accelerate my personal development and benefit the University of Manchester (UoM).

The first activity is the FOSTER Open Science Trainer Bootcamp (18-20 April in Barcelona, Spain; https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/event/open-science-trainer-bootcamp). During an intense three-day programme, FOSTER Open Science will train me to become a better open science trainer, covering topics such as Popular and innovative Open Science Workflows and Tools, Open Research Data, Open Code, Open Access and Training skills. After completing this bootcamp, I will be more confident and better equipped to provide training on open science to researchers at UoM and to share best practices. I will also be able to advise my peers on the academic and societal impact, relevance, and advantages of making open science part of the research workflow. I was selected to attend this bootcamp and many of the costs are sponsored by FOSTER, such as flights and half accommodation. £400 from the proposed project will cover the remaining costs of accommodation (£200) and subsistence (4 x £50 per diem).

The second activity is to attend and present my research at the international conference, Cosmic Rays - the salt in the star formation recipe (2-4 May in Florence, Italy; https://www.arcetri.astro.it/cosmicrays/). My talk “Synchrotron emission in protostellar jet shocks revealed by metre wavelength observations” has been been accepted as part of the conference program, which will also allow me to demonstrate how I practice open research. I have been awarded £80 through Horizon 2020 RadioNet to cover the costs of flights, and £660 through the proposed project would fund the remaining costs of accomodation (£400), airport transfers (£60) and subsistence (4 x £50 per diem). 

The third activity is to host a site at UoM for the Mozilla Global Sprint 2018 (10-11 May; https://mzl.la/global-sprint), a two-day collaborative hackathon where a diverse network of educators, engineers, artists, scientists, and many others come together in person and online to build projects for a healthy Internet. I was accepted into Round 4 of Mozilla Open Leaders in 2017, where I was mentored on a project to create an open science toolkit for astronomers (https://bit.ly/ROSAinterview). This year I am acting as a mentor in Round 5 and participating in the Global Sprint with the current cohort of Open Leaders. By hosting a site at UoM, the Global Sprint is an opportunity to connect students and staff at UoM with the global Open Source community; build and strengthen local community relationships; raise the profile of UoM; learn best practices for running welcoming, successful, open community events; and do something positive for the health of the Internet.

The fourth activity is to organise an Open Research Day called “Open UoM” for the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE) to increase the awareness and prevalence of Open Research practices at UoM. Locally, the Library works toward promoting Openness. With this activity, we hope to increase impact and collaboration between the Library and the various departments across campus by showcasing the resources and services available. By acting as ambassador between the Library and the FSE, I hope to break down the perceived barriers to Open Science by making it easy for researchers to work openly from proposal to publication by bringing the training to them. The impact aims to be a measurable increase in the KPI of publications deposited to Pure (e.g. 10% over the following year)​ and more papers having underlying data linked to​ (e.g. deposited into the institutional data repository).

Open UoM will take place on campus in September 2018, and be open and free to 100 FSE postgraduate students and staff members. Sessions would include a Welcome and brief remarks by representatives of the FSE and the Library; an invited talk to introduce Open Science/Reproducibility in Research; an Open Access at Manchester session led by members from the Library, which will include a workshop-style demonstration on how to make publications open access through the use of the institutional repository Pure; a session led by local representatives from the Software Sustainability Institute to cover Open Source and code sharing; a Research Data Management session by the Library which will include a demonstration of data management plans using DMPonline; and an invited talk on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in research. 
 
In addition to increased awareness of the benefits, UoM policies and services associated with Open Science, outputs include: a 1 day workshop with 5 sessions and 100 people trained; every participant will leave with a Pure profile set up with their publications submitted to the Open Access repository and an example Data Management Plan; Open Access to all presentations, training and organising material through GitHub and Figshare, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent so that the event can be easily adapted and reused by anyone; and a blogpost bringing the 'lessons learnt' and materials all together to help spread the word beyond UoM.

£3600 of the requested funding will go towards Open UoM: £200 toward travel costs for invited speaker from outside Manchester; £1250 for 2 coffee breaks for 125 people at £5/person during workshop; £1750 for lunch for 125 people at £14/person during workshop; £100 for name badges for participants; £50 for gifts for invited speakers; and £250 towards advertising and branding.


### 16. Please list three ways in which your proposed project will accelerate your personal development and/or benefit the University.
1. Many researchers view Open Access and Research Data Management policies as extra effort without much reward - many Principal Investigators describe writing Data Management Plans as just ticking a box for funding proposals and do not believe that it benefits the research being conducted. The proposed project aims to change the mindset of UoM researchers, and more specifically, frame the mindset of incoming early career researchers, to view these Open Science practices in a more positive way by demonstrating how Openness can benefit them and accelerate their careers by increasing the integrity of their results, the efficiency of their workflows, citation rates, impact, funding and job opportunities. 

2. Open Science is the movement to encourage collaboration over competition by making scientific research more transparent and research outputs freely available and accessible to all. I view Open Science as the gateway to a more inclusive, diverse and supportive culture in research and gaining back public trust in science. According to the Institution of Engineering and Technology (2015), women represent 47% of the UK workforce but only 13% of the STEM workforce are women, and these statistics are more discouraging for other aspects of diversity. By promoting Openness in STEM, the proposed project will encourage the culture to shift to be more inclusive, diverse, and make these fields (and higher education at UoM) more attractive and accessible to all.

3. The proposed project will accelerate my personal development by providing funding to a) cover the remaining costs of attending an Open Science Trainer bootcamp, where I will become a better open science trainer and develop my own trainings and training roadmap for UoM; b) present my research at an international conference; c) host a site for the Mozilla Global Sprint 2018, which will connect students and staff at UoM with the global Open Source community; and d) organise an Open Research Day to increase the awareness and prevalence of Open Research practices at the UoM.
