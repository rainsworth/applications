# Application For FSE Social Responsibility Funding Competition 2018/19

The vision of the University is to encourage all staff and students to engage with the University’s [Social Responsibility (SR) agenda](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/social-responsibility/) and consider what they can do to ‘make a difference’ within the University, in the local community and internationally. The funding available through this competition is to support the development and/or maintenance of a distinctive and impactful set of SR initiatives for the good of society and the environment. All initiatives will be considered but those relating to the following areas are particularly encouraged: Widening Participation, Research with Societal or environmental impact, and social responsibility in the curriculum.

#### Alignment and Quality: Provide a brief overview of your proposed initiative, including why you want to do this and who will benefit:

Many researchers view Open Access and Research Data Management policies as extra effort without much reward - many Principal Investigators describe writing Data Management Plans as just ticking a box for funding proposals and do not believe that it benefits the research being conducted. We want to change the mindset of researchers, and more specifically, frame the mindset of incoming early career researchers, to view these Open Science practices in a more positive way by demonstrating how Openness can benefit them and accelerate their careers by increasing the integrity of their results, the efficiency of their workflows, citation rates, impact, sustainability, funding and job opportunities. 

We therefore want to hold an Open Research Day for the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE) at the University of Manchester (UoM) to raise awareness of the benefits of – and lower the barriers to – Open Science. Furthermore, by promoting Openness in STEM we hope to encourage the culture to shift to be more inclusive, diverse, and make these fields more attractive and accessible to all.

The main beneficiaries will be postgraduate students and early career researchers in the FSE as we hope to break down the barriers to Open Science practices through this workshop and teach them how to maximise the impact of their research at the beginning of their careers. By also including senior researchers in this workshop, we hope to equip them with the awareness to encourage early career scientists to practice open access/data/source – in order to successfully mentor the next generation of open science practitioners we also need to target those who advise them. 

Making research results more accessible contributes to better and more efficient science, and to innovation in the public and private sectors. By training early career researchers on how to make their outputs freely available and accessible to all, we can begin to shift a traditionally closed culture to be more open, inclusive and diverse. More publications, data and codes will become available online for anyone to reuse or build off of, increasing contributions to science and society. Furthermore, if these researchers leave academia, they can bring these values with them into industry and promote inclusiveness in less diverse sectors such as tech. This initiative will also demonstrate the importance of communicating to the right audiences through Scott Taylor’s project 'Beyond Compliance', helping researchers improve the reach of their research and communicate to non-academics.


#### Alignment and Quality: Provide a brief outline on how the initiative links to the University’s Social Responsibility agenda:

Social responsibility is one of the three core strategic goals in the University of Manchester’s 2020 strategy, sitting equally alongside the University’s commitments to world-class research and outstanding learning and student experience. ‘Openness’ is at the heart of UoM’s expectations of good research conduct, but many researchers simply do not know how to implement open practices into their research workflows.

Open Science is the movement to encourage collaboration over competition by making scientific research more transparent and research outputs freely available and accessible to all. I view Open Science as the gateway to a more inclusive, diverse and supportive culture in research – which is also central to the Social Responsibility agenda – and gaining back public trust in science. According to the Institution of Engineering and Technology (2015), women represent 47% of the UK workforce but only 13% of the STEM workforce are women, and these statistics are more discouraging for other aspects of diversity. By promoting Openness in STEM, the proposed initiative will encourage the culture to shift to be more inclusive, diverse, and make these fields (and higher education at UoM) more attractive and accessible to all.


#### Innovative Thinking: Provide a brief outline of the activities planned, including any innovative features of the initiative:

Open UoM aims to take place on campus in September 2018 and be open and free to 50 FSE postgraduate students and staff members. A preliminary format for the day includes: 
*	A Welcome and brief remarks by the organisers representatives of the FSE and the Library. 
*	An invited talk on the topic: What is Open Science?/Barriers to Open Science/Reproducibility in Research. 
*	An Open Access at Manchester session led by members from the Library, which will include a workshop-style demonstration on how to make publications Open Access through the use of the institutional repository Pure. This session may also include a practical demonstration by Scott Taylor who is leading on a project on 'Beyond Compliance', which includes helping researchers find the right Twitter accounts and blogs to improve the reach of their research. 
*	A coffee break and time for networking.
*	An invited talk by local representatives from the Software Sustainability Institute to cover Open Source and code sharing.
*	Lunch and time for networking.
*	A Research Data Management session by the Library which will cover topics such as data organisation, sharing and backup. It will include a demonstration of Data Management Plans using DMPonline and using the institutional data repository. 
*	Another coffee break and time for networking. 
*	The final session will be an invited talk on the theme of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
*	The day will conclude with remarks which may include a brief overview of any remaining services related to Open Science offered by University not covered throughout the day.


#### Impact: What outcomes do you expect, and how will you measure the impact of the initiative?

In addition to increased awareness of the benefits, UoM policies and services associated with Open Science, outputs include:
*	A 1-day workshop with 5 sessions and 50 people trained
*	Every participant will leave with a Pure profile set up with their publications submitted to the Open Access repository and an example Data Management Plan.
*	Open Access to all presentations, training and organising material through GitHub and Figshare, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent so that the event can be easily adapted and reused by anyone.
*	A blogpost bringing the 'lessons learnt' and materials all together to help spread the word beyond UoM.

For this project, success would be attracting 50 participants to the workshop with a wide range of backgrounds, including postgraduate students, postdocs and senior research staff members, who engage with the sessions. Key indicators to measure impact will be a measurable increase in the number of publications deposited to Pure (e.g. increase of 5% over the following year) and more papers having underlying data linked to, for example, through the institutional data repository. We will also request feedback in the form of a questionnaire at the end of the workshop to measure the response of the participants in the workshop, which will be anonymised and made openly available through the workshop GitHub repository.


#### Sustainability: How will these activities be embedded and sustained in the future? 

Project Management will be conducted on GitHub so that it is easily accessible and reusable. The project website will be hosted using GitHub Pages, and can include a blog to share the project progress along the way in addition to a project recap at the end, bringing the 'lessons learnt' and materials all together to help spread the word beyond UoM. All presentations and training materials will be included in the GitHub repository or on Figshare in order to be accessible to the entire community, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent. If the initiative is a success, then it can become an annual occurrence and scaled up each year to include more participants.
