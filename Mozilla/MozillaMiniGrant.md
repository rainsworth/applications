## Project Summary

**Project Title:** Open UoM

**What is the total project budget (in USD)?** $3,500.00

**How much money (in USD) are you requesting?** $3,500.00

**Anticipated project start date:** 4/1/2018

**Duration of project (in months)** 6

**Project Description:**

Objectives: Many researchers view Open Access policies as extra effort without much reward - we want to demonstrate how Open Science can benefit researchers and accelerate their careers by increasing the integrity of their results, the efficiency of their workflows, citation rates, impact, funding and job opportunities. Furthermore, Open Science is a gateway to a more inclusive, diverse and supportive culture in research and gaining back public trust in science. We therefore want to hold an Open Research Day for the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE) at the University of Manchester (UoM) called Open UoM. The objectives are to make members of the Faculty aware of these benefits of Open Science, current Open Access policies at UoM, and the services provided by the University to help maximize the impact of their research.

Activities: Open UoM will take place on campus in September 2018, and be open and free to 100 FSE students and staff members. A preliminary format for the day includes a Welcome and brief remarks by representatives of the FSE and the Library. This will be followed by an invited talk to introduce Open Science/Reproducibility in Research and then an Open Access at Manchester session led by members from the Library, which will include a workshop-style demonstration on how to make publications open access through the use of the institutional repository Pure. This will be followed by a coffee break and then a session led by local representatives from the Software Sustainability Institute to cover Open Source and code sharing. We will then break for lunch, followed by a Research Data Management session by the Library and will include a demonstration of data management plans using DMPonline. There will be another coffee break followed by the final session, which will be an invited talk on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The day will conclude with remarks which may include a brief overview of any remaining services related to Open Science offered by the University not covered throughout the day.

Outputs: In addition to increased awareness of the benefits and UoM policies associated with Open Science, every participant will leave with a Pure profile set up with their publications submitted to the open access repository and an example data management plan.

Outcomes: The impact aims to be a measurable increase in the KPI of publications deposited to Pure (e.g. 10% over the following year) and more papers having underlying data linked to.

## Project Support

**Project Purpose.**

Open UoM is an event aiming to increase the awareness and prevalence of Open Research practices at the University of Manchester.

**Describe the issue/problem you are trying to address.**

Many researchers view Open Access and Research Data Management policies as extra effort without much reward - many Principal Investigators describe writing Data Management Plans as just ticking a box for funding proposals and do not believe that it benefits the research being conducted. We want to change the mindset of researchers, and more specifically, frame the mindset of incoming early career researchers, to view these Open Science practices in a more positive way by demonstrating how Openness can benefit them and accelerate their careers by increasing the integrity of their results, the efficiency of their workflows, citation rates, impact, funding and job opportunities.

Open Science is the movement to encourage collaboration over competition by making scientific research more transparent and research outputs freely available and accessible to all. I view Open Science as the gateway to a more inclusive, diverse and supportive culture in research and gaining back public trust in science. According to the Institution of Engineering and Technology (2015), women represent 47% of the UK workforce but only 13% of the STEM workforce are women, and these statistics are more discouraging for other aspects of diversity.

We therefore want to hold an Open Research Day for the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE) at the University of Manchester (UoM) to raise awareness of the benefits of Open Science, current Open Access policies at UoM and the services provided by the UoM Library to lower barriers to Open Science, help maximize the impact of research within the Faculty and increase collaboration between the Faculty and Library. Furthermore, by promoting Openness in STEM we hope to encourage the culture to shift to be more inclusive, diverse, and make these fields more attractive and accessible to all.

**List key project activities (what will you do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities, e.g. products, publications, number of workshops held and people trained) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the project period).**

Activities: Open UoM will take place on campus in September 2018, and be open and free to 100 FSE postgraduate students and staff members. A preliminary format for the day includes:
* A Welcome and brief remarks by representatives of the FSE and the Library.
* An invited talk on the topic What is Open Science?/Barriers to Open Science/Reproducibility in Research.
* An Open Access at Manchester session by members from the Library, which will include a workshop-style demonstration on how to make publications Open Access through the use of the institutional repository Pure. This session may also include a practical demonstration by Scott Taylor who is leading on a project on 'Beyond Compliance', which includes helping researchers find the right Twitter accounts and blogs to improve the reach of their research.
* A coffee break and time for networking.
* An invited talk by local representatives from the Software Sustainability Institute to cover Open Source and code sharing.
* Lunch and time for networking.
* A Research Data Management session by the Library which will cover topics such as data organization, sharing and backup. It will include a demonstration of Data Management Plans using DMPonline and using the institutional data repository.
* Another coffee break and time for networking.
* The final session will be an invited talk on the theme of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
* The day will conclude with remarks which may include a brief overview of any remaining services related to Open Science offered by University not covered throughout the day.

Outputs: In addition to increased awareness of the benefits, UoM policies and services associated with Open Science, outputs include:
* A 1 day workshop with 5 sessions and 100 people trained
* Every participant will leave with a Pure profile set up with their publications submitted to the Open Access repository and an example Data Management Plan.
* Open Access to all presentations, training and organizing material through GitHub and Figshare, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent so that the event can be easily adapted and reused by anyone.
* A blog post bringing the 'lessons learned' and materials all together to help spread the word beyond UoM.

Outcomes: The impact aims to be a measurable increase in the KPI of publications deposited to Pure (e.g. 10% over the following year) and more papers having underlying data linked to (e.g. deposited into the institutional data repository). This event can also serve to provide conference/workshop organizing experience for postgraduates and early career researchers who help in the running of the workshop.

**Provide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data.**

For this project, success would be attracting 100 participants to the workshop with a wide range of backgrounds, including postgraduate students, postdocs and senior research staff members, who engage with the sessions. Key indicators to measure project outcomes will be a measurable increase in the number of publications deposited to Pure (e.g. increase of 10% over the following year) and more papers having underlying data linked to, for example, through the institutional data repository. We will also request feedback in the form of a questionnaire at the end of the workshop to measure the response of the participants in the workshop, which will be anonymized and made openly available through the workshop GitHub repository.

**Explain who will benefit from the project and how you will engage with them.**

The main beneficiaries will be postgraduate students and early career researchers in the FSE as we hope to break down the barriers to Open Science practices through this workshop and teach them how to maximise the impact of their research at the beginning of their careers. By also including senior researchers in this workshop, we hope to equip them with the awareness to encourage early career scientists to practice open access/data/source - in order to successfully mentor the next generation of open science practitioners we also need to target those who advise them. Finally, we hope this event will foster increased collaboration between the Library and the FSE - the Library already conducts Research Data Management workshops across campus and we hope to schedule these more regularly within FSE.

To encourage students and staff to attend the event, we will engage with them through social media, school boards to get the senior researchers engaged, advertisements through posters, emails and a project website. During the event, we will ensure plenty of opportunities for engagement such as through workshop-style sessions, question and answer sessions, time for networking with other attendees, and ample opportunity to provide feedback.

We will not charge participants to attend.

**Describe the geographic location(s) in which this project will be implemented.**

This project will be implemented at the University of Manchester in Manchester, UK and in the short term will benefit the postgraduate students, postdocs and staff who attend. In the long term, early career researchers are highly mobile as a group so the event will likely have a much broader reach. In addition, all event materials will be Open Access, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent, so that the event can be easily adapted and reused by anyone, increasing the impact of the project.

**List any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project, and note how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges.**

The challenge associated with this project is shifting the culture in academia to move from traditionally closed research practices to open and inclusive practices. Mozilla can help us overcome this challenge as they have the reputation, resources and power to inspire change. Funding this project will allow us to raise awareness of the benefits of Open Research practices within the Faculty of Science and Engineering, train both early career and senior researchers in the methods recommended by the University, increase collaboration between the Faculty and the Library who are the leading promoters of Openness on campus, and improve assessment of UoM researchers on Open Access as part of Research Excellence Framework 2021.

**List your project partners, if any, and the role they will play in the project.**

Rachael Ainsworth, a Research Associate and Open Science Champion within the School of Physics and Astronomy in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, will lead this project with significant collaboration with Rosie Higman, a Research Data Librarian within Research Data Services at the UoM Library.

Rosie has experience of collaborating on similar Open Science events including an OpenCon Satellite event and an international one-day conference on  Engaging Researchers in Good Data Management. She will help to run the Research Data Management session and lead coordination with the UoM Library. The Library will play a large role in the project as they already have many of the materials and sessions designed for this exact purpose - our aim is to connect the students and staff in the FSE with these resources and showcase Library services. We piloted the Research Data Management session for Astrophysics in December 2017 and received positive feedback - we now want to conduct it on a larger scale with measurable impact. The Library will play the role of leading the Open Access at Manchester and Research Data Management sessions at Open UoM, providing any opening and closing remarks, and helping with promotion and running of the event.

Professor Anna Scaife, Director of Business Engagement and Innovation within School of Physics and Astronomy in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and Co-Director of Policy@Manchester, will act as primary advisor for the project. Anna is currently developing and delivering a strategy to increase engagement, by University of Manchester academics, in policy development in the UK and internationally. She works across all three faculties, developing bespoke models of engagement with each, helping build capacity and understanding of policy process and impact. Her experience and expertise will be extremely valuable for this project.

**Mozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community?**

Project Management will be conducted on GitHub so that it is easily accessible and reusable. The project website will be hosted using GitHub Pages, and can include a blog to share the project progress along the way in addition to a project recap at the end, bringing the 'lessons learned' and materials all together to help spread the word beyond UoM. All presentations and training materials will be included in the GitHub repository or on Figshare in order to be accessible to the entire community, shared under a Creative Commons license of CC-0 or CC-BY or equivalent.

**Are other organizations working toward outcomes similar to those described in this proposal? If yes, explain how your work complements that of others or fills a key gap.**

The Open Movement is gaining momentum across the globe. Initiatives such as Mozilla Open Leaders, OpenCon, Open Access Week and Open Data Week are shining a spotlight on the academic, economic and societal benefits of Openness, and inspiring the next generation of researchers to initiate change.

Locally, the UoM Library works toward the outcomes described in this proposal. Research Data Services provide both online and in person training on Research Data Management, and facilitates Open at UoM through organizing unlimited Dropbox storage for increased sharing, generous allowances for published datasets through Mendeley Data, and promotes Open Access through Pure. With this project, we hope to increase impact and collaboration between the Library and the various departments across campus by showcasing the resources and services available - researchers are more likely to take something on board if one of their own is connecting the dots. By acting as ambassador between the Library and the FSE, I hope to break down the perceived barriers to Open Science by making it easy for researchers to work openly from proposal to publication by bringing the training to them.

**Describe how this project fits into your organization’s mission and goals.**

Social responsibility is one of the three core strategic goals in the University of Manchester’s 2020 strategy, sitting equally alongside the University’s commitments to world-class research and outstanding learning and student experience. Further to this, The UoM Library plays a key role in having a positive impact on people’s lives through the establishment of ‘openness’ as the default, with the aim to increase the availability and accessibility of Library content, data and services to non-traditional audiences, evolving current practices around the acquisition, exposure and development of content, data and services to incorporate ‘open principles’.

**How does this project contribute to a healthier Internet?**

Making research results more accessible contributes to better and more efficient science, and to innovation in the public and private sectors. By training early career researchers on how to make their outputs freely available and accessible to all, we can begin to shift a traditionally closed culture to be more open, inclusive and diverse. More publications, data and codes will become available online for anyone to reuse or build off of, increasing contributions to science and society. Furthermore, if these researchers leave academia, they can bring these values with them into industry and promote inclusiveness in less diverse sectors such as tech. This project will also demonstrate the importance of communicating to the right audiences through Scott Taylor’s project 'Beyond Compliance', helping researchers improve the reach of their research and communicate to non-academics.
