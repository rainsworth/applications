# Mozilla Festival 2017

Below you will find my session proposal for [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org/) 2017, which was accepted into the Open Innovation Space. The session description and outline evolved as it got closer to the event. You can view the original session submission/issue [here](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/582), you can view the schedule/guidebook description [here](https://guidebook.com/guide/114124/event/16741309/), and you can read the session recap [here](https://github.com/rainsworth/ROSA/issues/15). 

## **Welcome to the MozFest 2017 Call for Proposals**

_MozFest sessions cover a wide range of topics, but share two important qualities: they are interactive and inclusive. Successful sessions are not lectures or presentations with slides, but are designed to challenge and encourage audience participation._

_Sessions may have anywhere from 3 to 25 participants, with a vast range of abilities and ages. Everyone at the festival is welcome to attend your session._

_Anyone may submit a proposal for MozFest 2017. Once you have submitted your session, it will enter an open curation process on GitHub. All information you submit here, except your email address and Twitter handle, will be publicly available on GitHub. Mozilla may contact you via email in regard to your submission._

_In addition to English, this year we are accepting proposals in Spanish, French and German._

_If you would like to submit a session and have difficulty using this text-based form, please email us to discuss accessibility options._

_If you have any questions, please email festival@mozilla.org._

_Submission deadline: August 1, 2017_

### **Festival Spaces**

_At MozFest, sessions are thematically organised into spaces. Please read the brief descriptions of each space here before answering the following questions._

**What space do feel your session will best contribute to?**

Open Innovation

**Is there an alternate space your session could contribute to?**

Web Literacy

### **Describe your session**

**Session name**

Crafting an Open Science Resource Kit - What tools do you wish you had at the start of your career in research?

**What will happen in your session?** (max 120 words)

In this session, participants will brainstorm, compile and develop an Open Science Resource Kit. 20 minutes will be spent brainstorming and discussing what this kit might look like and include – what open access, open data and open source tools from around the web would be useful for a researcher to have at the very start of their career? How can we present this information to senior researchers, who may be less experienced with these tools, so they can promote open research practices to their students and research teams? The next 40 minutes will be spent compiling these resources in a collaborative Etherpad and organising/documenting them within a GitHub repository/webpage.

**What is the goal or outcome of your session?** (max 120 words)

Many scientific fields are still dominated by closed research practices. It is often difficult to reproduce results and frustrating to build/iterate on the research of others. The reasons for this are diverse, but one prominent issue is a lack of understanding about HOW to work in an open way. The goal of this session is to compile an Open Science Resource Kit general enough for anyone to use, contribute to or adapt. Ideally, it will be pitched at senior researchers so they are best equipped to encourage early career scientists to work openly - in order to successfully mentor the next generation of open science practitioners we also need to target those who advise them.

**After the festival, how will you and your participants take the learning activities forward?** (max 120 words)

The Open Science Resource Kit will continuously evolve over time – it will rely on contributions and updates as people use it and more open science tools become available. Not only will the general kit grow over time, but it can also be adapted to suit the needs of different research fields and audiences. I envision the kit to begin as a glorified list of links with brief descriptions, which will eventually develop into a well-documented guide on WHY you should research openly and WHAT tools are available around the web to enable this. Traditionally closed scientific culture will change as incoming researchers practice openly but we still need to empower the current community with the resources to encourage it.

**How much time will you need?**

60 mins

**How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?** (max 120 words)

This session can be successful with any number of participants. If 30 participants attend, the Resource Kit may develop faster and benefit from more diversity and range in input. If three participants attend, then we can facilitate more of a discussion and dig deep into the issues regarding open research practices (why senior researchers might be adverse and how to change the defensive mentality of wanting to protect intellectual property) and what is needed to develop the project.

**Would you like to deliver this session bilingually in one of the following languages?**

### **Travel support**

_MozFest offers limited places for travel sponsorship covering flights and accommodation over the festival weekend. These stipends are offered to those who need support traveling to the event and would have no other means to attend through work or personal covering of costs. We offer these stipends to encourage diversity in facilitators._

**Do you require a travel stipend?**

I do not require a travel stipend as I, or my work, can cover my costs

**Session materials**

_Many attendees bring a personal device (smartphone, laptop or tablet) to the festival. We can provide you with a projector and office supplies (paper, pens, post-it notes). Please note we may not be capable of supporting all your needs but will work with you to provide the best solution possible._

**If your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.** (max 120 words)

This session does not require additional materials beyond a projector and office supplies (paper, pens, post-it notes).
