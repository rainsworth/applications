# Mozilla Festival 2018

Below you will find our (Anna Scaife, Sally Cooper, Mateusz Malenta, Benjamin Shaw and my) session proposal for [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org/) 2018. You can view the session submission/issue [here](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/mozfest-program-2018/issues/569). 


### Festival Spaces

**What space do feel your session will best contribute to?**

Openness

**Is there an alternate space your session could contribute to?**

Decentralisation

### **Describe your session**

**Session name**

Pulsar Hunters

**What will happen in your session?** (max 120 words)

The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics needs your help in our search for pulsars - really dense dead spinning stars. Faced with tens of thousands of pulsar candidates, we need your help to identify interesting patterns in the data to improve our machine learning classifier and tell us which pulsars we should point our telescopes at again!

Pulsar Hunters is an interactive Open Science installation where participants can learn in person about pulsar signals from Jodrell Bank researchers and contribute to classifying real data taken with the LOFAR Telescope. As part of a global citizen science project, you can make a significant contribution to our scientific endeavour and share your feedback directly with the scientists.

**What is the goal or outcome of your session?** (max 120 words)

During the event, our goals are 
- to meet a daily target of classifications (e.g. 1500 per day),
- demystify the science behind pulsars through the use of 3D printed models,
- engage with a non-standard audience, and 
- active feedback directly between participants and scientists.

The outcomes of the session will be 
- increased contributions to the global science project,
- widening of the Pulsar Hunter community, and 
- adding a MozFest results page so participants can see their combined contribution (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/pulsar-hunters/about/results).

**After the festival, how will you and your participants take the learning activities forward?** (max 120 words)

Participants can continue to interact with the project beyond MozFest through the web interface and they can also volunteer for increased levels of involvement (such as beta tester, project moderator, etc.). Discussion can continue through social media interaction (https://twitter.com/PulsarHunters) and in the Pulsar Hunters forum (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/pulsar-hunters/talk). 

The candidates selected by volunteers taking part in Pulsar Hunters will be used to create a labelled dataset that will help us to train our machine learning classifier. This will then help us to find patterns in pulsar data, which can later be used to test various theories, including Einsteinâ€™s Theory of General Relativity.


**How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?** (max 120 words)

Depending on the space available, the installation is designed to accommodate about 10 people at a time: 5 participants can classify pulsars using our interactive Raspberry Pi based system and 5 can be in discussion with scientists. However, we are very flexible in terms of the amount of equipment we can bring and therefore number of participants at a given time.

There will be a sufficient number of scientists present to talk participants through the project and the science behind the project while participants wait for terminals, in order to maximise the connections between facilitators and participants. Participants can work as individuals, pairs or teams to classify pulsars.


### Session Format

**Choose from the formats below that most suits your session delivery**

Gallery: This format hosts interactive exhibits, installations, games, stalls- designed for 1:1 self driven experiences or small group activities. Often these experiences or activities are not scheduled time blocks but take place over the day or weekend allowing access and interaction at any time

**How much time you will need?**

All weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session
